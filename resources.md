## Useful Resources for Machine Learning (ML) in Drug Discovery

### Books

[Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130) -
To apply ML in drug discovery, one has to understand data science. This book provides a practical introduction to data science with lots of great code examples.  It covers Python, statistics, probability, clustering, databases, and some basic machine learning.

[Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn: Develop machine learning and deep learning models with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-PyTorch-Scikit-Learn-learning/dp/1801819319) -
This book is probably the best reference for someone who wants to get started with machine learning. It covers a wide range of topics from conventional machine learning approaches to recent deep learning advances.

[Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/149207294X) -
To effectively use ML in drug discovery or anywhere else, one needs to understand statistics. This book takes a pragmatic approch with lots of code examples to help readers to explore concenpts.


### Tutorials

[TeachOpenCADD](https://github.com/volkamerlab/TeachOpenCADD) - This is a great set of tutorials from Andrea Volkamer's group that use Open Source software to teach Computer-Aided Drug Design concepts including molecular similarity, applications of machine learning, and pharmacophore analysis.

[Practical Cheminformatics Tutorials](https://github.com/PatWalters/practical_cheminformatics_tutorials) - a set of tutorials for learning Cheminformatics. The tutorials begin with basics like SMILES and SMARTS, as well a reaction enumeration.  The tutorials also include a range of SAR analysis and machine learning tasks.

### Blogs

[Practical Cheminformatics](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/) - This is a blog where I post once a month or so. These posts typically contain code that demonstrates various aspects of cheminformatics; clustering, machine learning, data visualization, etc. I occasionally throw in posts containing opinions on things like AI and getting a job.

[Is Life Worth Living](https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/) - A great blog from Iwatobipen (aka pen), whose posts are chock full of great code examples.  Pen always seems to be up on the latest methods and posts interesting examples on a variety of topics ranging from quantum chemistry to machine learning.

[The RDKit Blog](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/) - Greg Landrum is the primary contributor to, and BDFL, of the RDKit.  In addition to the latest and greatest features in the RDKit, Greg's posts also touch on a number of key issues in Cheminformatics and ML, such as dealing with unbalanced datasets and the impact of fingerprint folding on similarity searching.

[Cheminformania](http://www.cheminformania.com/) - A set of very practical posts by Esben Jannik Bjerrum and friends that primarily focus on the applications of deep learning in drug discovery.  These posts provide several useful code examples.

### Videos

[3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) has an excellent introduction to neural networks. Each of these videos is about 20 minutes.
